# LeetCode Solutions by Topic ðŸš€  

## ðŸ“š Welcome!  
This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topics and difficulty levels.  
Itâ€™s perfect for beginners and those looking to systematically improve their problem-solving skills.  


## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
The solutions are categorized into folders based on topics. Each folder contains fil es for individual problems, and every file includes:  

- Link to the problem
- Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard)  
- My solution  
- Comments and explanations  

Each problem file is named with its corresponding difficulty level in parentheses. For example, a problem titled `reverse-linked-list(e).cs` would indicate an **Easy** level problem, while `merge-intervals(m).cs` would be a **Medium** level problem, and `maximum-subarray(h).cs` would be a **Hard** level problem.  


## ðŸŒŸ For Beginners  
Starting with LeetCode can be challenging, but donâ€™t worry! Follow these steps:  

1. Begin with **Easy problems** from a topic you're comfortable with (e.g., Arrays or Strings).  
2. Break the problem into smaller steps and plan your approach before coding.  
3. Focus on understanding the time complexity and improving your code efficiency over time.
